This is an application template built with Backbone and Hapi. It uses Grunt as a taskrunner as well.

When I first started working with javascript it was simple enough to get a basic idea of how it works. The problem is how do you transition from little things, like changing the text of a page, to making a full blown app like Facebook. Well if you find out how, please let me know. In the mean time here is a little step in the right direction.

I chose Backbone as the javascript framework because it is lightweight,  easy to learn, and has good documentation. Angular and Ember are also extremely good but are a little harder to get started with. At least in my opinion.  

Hapi vs Express because I learned Hapi first.

Grunt vs Gulp...reasons?
