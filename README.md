# Spine
Think of this as the Spine to your application. It uses Backbone for structure, Hapi for server management and routing, LESS as a css preprocessor and Grunt as a task runner. Oh and Node, because reasons...

This is not a production level template (although there is no reason it can't be). It is for the purpose of giving new Javascript developers easy tools to use and learn on their way to production level applications.

With that said, lets get coding!!

# Installation

This application is assuming you have <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">node</a> installed and have used the command line a some point.

Also I would recommend downloading the Github desktop application but that is more optional

Step 1: Clone into directory of your choice
        or
        Download source(zip file)

Step 2: Open a bash shell and navigate to the directory containing Spine

Step 3: Run "npm install"

Step 4: Run "npm install grunt-cli -g"    
        For linux users you may need to run "sudo npm install grunt-cli -g"

Step 5: Open a browser and navigate to localhost:8000


# Uses

The primary use of this is to have a simple working application that shows you some basics about how single page applications work. While there are TONS of application templates out there that do the same thing, this is supposed to let you learn as you go through it by using easy to learn and well documented tools.

Please change the styles and make it your own. Use it to build a personal app! Hell you can even build a production app out of it. You are only missing a few tools.

Please leave some feedback!!
