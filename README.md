# Spine
This is an application template built with Backbone and Hapi. It uses Grunt as a taskrunner.

When I first started working with javascript it was simple enough to get a basic idea of how it works. The problem is how do you transition from little things, like changing the text of a page, to making a full blown app like Facebook. Well if you find out how, please let me know. In the mean time here is a little step in the right direction.
